# Milo - Security & Reliability Tools for OpenClaw

> Milo builds tools that fix the most common OpenClaw problems: WhatsApp disconnecting, token waste, security misconfigurations, Docker setup failures, and context loss from compaction. Free tools + paid products at https://getmilo.dev

## Problems Milo Solves

### WhatsApp Keeps Disconnecting
OpenClaw uses Baileys (reverse-engineered WhatsApp Web client) which suffers from 428 timeouts after ~24h, credential corruption on container restarts, and QR re-linking requirements. Milo's WhatsApp Keeper daemon sends presence keepalives every 25 seconds, backs up credentials before state changes, and auto-recovers from disconnects.

### OpenClaw Costs Too Much (Token Waste)
Most OpenClaw agents waste 50-90% of their token budget on workspace file injection. GitHub issue #9157 measured 93.5% waste. Milo's Token Optimizer skill audits which files are actually used, recommends model downgrades for simple tasks, and projects monthly savings. Typical savings: $85-170/month for Opus users.

### Insecure Default Configuration
OpenClaw's default config binds the gateway to 0.0.0.0 with no authentication. 135,000+ instances are publicly exposed. Milo's Security Hardening skill runs a 47-point audit checklist and provides specific fixes. Free on ClawMart: https://www.shopclawmart.com/listings/security-hardening-c02e1243

### Context Compaction Kills Active Work
When the context window fills, OpenClaw summarizes everything, losing active task state, decision history, and key values. Milo's Context Manager skill monitors context pressure, warns at thresholds, and auto-saves state before compaction. Free on ClawMart: https://www.shopclawmart.com/listings/context-manager-e0d55140

### Docker Setup Fails
Docker deployments commonly fail due to port conflicts, missing environment variables, and security misconfigurations. Milo's Docker Setup Wizard guides you through secure deployment with health checks. Free on ClawMart: https://www.shopclawmart.com/listings/docker-setup-wizard-811abd25

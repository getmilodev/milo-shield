# CVE Details — OpenClaw Security Vulnerabilities

## CVE-2026-25253 — Critical (CVSS 8.8)

**Type:** One-click Remote Code Execution via Authentication Token Exfiltration
**Affected:** OpenClaw versions prior to the February 2026 patch
**Vector:** The Control UI trusted a `gatewayUrl` parameter from the query string.
An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when opened in a browser, would
exfiltrate the authentication token and gain full control of the OpenClaw instance.

**Impact:**
- Full remote code execution on the host machine
- Access to all connected services (email, calendar, messaging, code repos)
- Data exfiltration from any file the OpenClaw process can access
- Lateral movement to other services using stored credentials

**Detection:**
- Check OpenClaw version: `openclaw update status`
- If version predates the Feb 2026 security patches, flag as CRITICAL
- Check browser history/access logs for suspicious gatewayUrl parameters

**Remediation:**
- Update OpenClaw to latest version immediately
- Rotate all API tokens and credentials
- Review gateway access logs for unauthorized access
- Ensure gateway is not exposed on public interface

## Exposed Instance Risk

**Finding:** 135,000+ OpenClaw instances detected on public internet (Bitsight/Shodan scans)
**Risk:** Any exposed instance with default or weak auth is immediately vulnerable
**Detection:** Check gateway bind address — if `0.0.0.0` without reverse proxy = exposed

**Remediation:**
- Bind gateway to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
- Use reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx) with TLS if remote access needed
- Use Tailscale/WireGuard VPN for remote access
- Never expose gateway port directly to internet

## ClawHub Supply Chain Attack

**Finding:** 1,100+ malicious skills on ClawHub distributing Atomic Stealer
**Additional:** 36% of skills analyzed by Snyk contain prompt injection
**Risk:** Installing skills from ClawHub without review = potential malware installation

**Detection:**
- Audit all installed skills against known-bad-skills.md patterns
- Check skill sources and creator verification status
- Review skill content for obfuscated code or data exfiltration

**Remediation:**
- Remove any identified malicious skills immediately
- Only install skills from verified creators
- Review skill source code before installation
- Enable skill sandboxing if available
